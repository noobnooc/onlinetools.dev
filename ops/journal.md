# Autopilot journal

Newest first. One entry per run; keep each under ~25 lines. Template:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line theme of the day>
- Health: <smoke result, live version, anything odd>
- Metrics: <requests / visitors vs. last week, notable movers>
- Shipped: <PR links + one line each; "nothing" is a valid answer>
- Cloudflare: <changes, or "none">
- Community: <issues/PRs handled>
- Learned: <anything the next run should know>
- Next: <what the next run should consider first>

## 2026-10-28 — Autopilot set up
- Health: smoke test 15/15 green; live version v2026.09.14 (Worker version `ab4991ed`).
- Metrics: baseline backfilled for 10-21 → 10-28: ~2k requests, ~300–1,400 page views and ~350–740 daily visitors; 0 5xx. A large share of 4xx is vulnerability scanners probing `/.env`, `/phpinfo.php`, `/.git/config`.
- Shipped: the autopilot skill, its scripts, and this `ops/` folder.
- Cloudflare: none.
- Learned: merging to `main` deploys automatically (Workers Builds trigger "Deploy default branch"); every branch push gets a preview version ("Deploy non-production branches"). The proxy-injected Cloudflare token works for wrangler but not for the Builds REST API — use the Cloudflare MCP for Builds.
- Next: find which tool pages actually get human traffic (7 days, `requestSource: "eyeball"`, HTML only); pick the first headline item from the backlog.
